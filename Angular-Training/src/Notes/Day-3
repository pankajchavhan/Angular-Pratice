* How to load Dynamic Component *

step1- create component 
step2 - In app.routing.module.ts -> Inside Routes Arrary -> create object eg.
       const Routes:Routes = [
        {
            path: 'login',  //path name
            component: logincomponent
        }
       ]  

step 3- go to app.component.html -> make sure <router-outlet></router-outlet> is added 
      (if not aailable add it manually)

step 4 - then hit URL in browser for particular path
        e.g.  localhost:4200/login


** Types of Routing **
1) Redirect Routing
2) Wild card routing
    
    1) Redirect Routing (it is used to redirect on default path)

    step 1- create component 
    step 2- In app.routing.module.ts -> Inside Routes Arrary -> create object eg.
       const Routes:Routes = [
           {
             path:'',          //empty path
             redirectTo:'login',   // when there is empty path it should redirect to login path
             pathMatch:'full'     // it means path should match exactly empty
           }
       ]  

    step 3- check in url by hitting localhost:4200 -----> 
            then it should redirect to localhost:4200/login
       
    2) Wild card routing (it is used to show page not found error when user hits wrong URL)

    step 1- create component  e.g ng g c page-not-found

    step 2- In app.routing.module.ts -> Inside Routes Arrary -> create object for wild card     routing    at the end of routes array because it wil not check the path after wild c ard  routing object  eg.
       const Routes:Routes = [
          // redirect routing
           {
             path:'',          //empty path
             redirectTo:'login',   // when there is empty path it should redirect to login path
             pathMatch:'full'     // it means path should match exactly empty
           },
           {
            path: 'login',  //path name
            component: logincomponent
           },

           //wild card routing
           {
            path: '**',  //path name            
            component: pagenotfoundcomponent
           }
       ]  

    step 3- check in url by hitting localhost:4200/edjvdf -----> 
            then it should show page not found error
